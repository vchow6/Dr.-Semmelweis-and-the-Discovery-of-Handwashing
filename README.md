<p>This is Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818 and active at the Vienna General Hospital. If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about <em>childbed fever</em>: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and <em>wash their hands</em>!</p>
<p>In this project, I reanalyzed the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of <em>handwashing</em>.</p>

## About the dataset
Dataset includes details of number of childbirths and number of women death due to childbirth, most of them from childbed fever, at two clinics at the Vienna General Hospital from the years 1841 to 1846. This dataset was provided by Data Camp as part of their data learning programs.

## Conclusion of project
* Proportion of deaths was consistently much higher in Clinic 1. The only difference between the clinics was that many medical students served at Clinic 1, while mostly midwife students served at Clinic 2 where they only tended to the women giving birht, while the medical students also spent time in the autopsy rooms examining corposes

* Handwashing practices were implemented, and over time the proportion of death decreased in large number. The practice reduced the monthly proportion of death on average by 8 percentage points (From 10% before handwashing practices to 2% after handwashing practices)

* By calculating the 95% confidence interval, it shows that handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points.
